# dbdump


Introduction
============

Allows a database dump to be taken and downloaded.

PhpMyAdmin is able to do exactly the same, but this is a single file that can be uploaded quickly alongside an existing site, and supports systems like wordpress and concrete5.

Useful for when a quick database dump is required, just enter the user account details at the top and upload.
